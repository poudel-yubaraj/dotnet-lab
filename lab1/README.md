# Lab 1

## Things Learnt in this lab
- In this lab we learnt anout the basic of git and github along with how to use them.
- We understood how to check the status of the repo.
- We used branching to create a new feature in the code while keeping the main code isolated. 
- Learnt to use the github like pull request, manage access, fork and clone repositories.
- I have created a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/poudel-yubaraj/dotnet-lab/blob/main/lab1/git-cheatsheet.md) of this lab to remember for future use.
